% SAMPLESET - Sample a non degenerate set. To be used by OPTIMALRANSAC.
% This code was extraced with minor changes from RANSAC.
%
% Usage:
%
% [M, inliers, ninliers] = sampleSet(x, fittingfn, distfn, s, t, maxDataTrials)
%
% Arguments:
%     x         - Data sets to which we are seeking to fit a model M
%                 It is assumed that x is of size [d x Npts]
%                 where d is the dimensionality of the data and Npts is
%                 the number of data points.
%
%     fittingfn - Handle to a function that fits a model to s
%                 data from x.  It is assumed that the function is of the
%                 form: 
%                    M = fittingfn(x)
%                 Note it is possible that the fitting function can return
%                 multiple models (for example up to 3 fundamental matrices
%                 can be fitted to 7 matched points).  In this case it is
%                 assumed that the fitting function returns a cell array of
%                 models.
%                 If this function cannot fit a model it should return M as
%                 an empty matrix.
%
%     distfn    - Handle to a function that evaluates the
%                 distances from the model to data x.
%                 It is assumed that the function is of the form:
%                    [inliers, M] = distfn(M, x, t)
%                 This function must evaluate the distances between points
%                 and the model returning the indices of elements in x that
%                 are inliers, that is, the points that are within distance
%                 't' of the model.  Additionally, if M is a cell array of
%                 possible models 'distfn' will return the model that has the
%                 most inliers.  If there is only one model this function
%                 must still copy the model to the output.  After this call M
%                 will be a non-cell object representing only one model. 
%
%     s         - The minimum number of samples from x required by
%                 fittingfn to fit a model.
%
%     t         - The distance threshold between a data point and the model
%                 used to decide whether the point is an inlier or not.
%
%     maxTrials - Maximum number of iterations. This parameter is optional and
%                 defaults to 1000.
%
% Returns:
%     M         - The model having the greatest number of inliers.
%     inliers   - An array of indices of the elements of x that were
%                 the inliers for the best model.
%     ninliers  - Number of inliers.
